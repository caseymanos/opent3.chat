https://cloneathon.t3.chat/ I want to win this. I wanna have a very slick useful, chat interface for T-3 chat clone to win this. I would like to use everything within the bounds of the project requirements. Strongly leaning towards supabase if that works? Or would this not count? Create a high level plan of attack and leading open source tools to build this, vs what is likely being used for t3 now

Edit
I'll analyze the T3 chat cloneathon requirements and create a winning strategy for you.

1. Visual Reasoning Chain
Unlike T3 Chat's black box responses, show users exactly how the AI thinks through problems with animated step-by-step visualization.

2. Conversation DNA
Create visual "fingerprints" for conversations showing topic evolution, sentiment flow, and knowledge gaps - making it easy to understand long conversations at a glance.

3. AI Code Reviewer Squad
Deploy multiple specialized AI agents (security, performance, architecture) that collaboratively review code in real-time during discussions.

4. Smart Context Bubbles
Implement floating context cards that appear when relevant - showing related files, past conversations, or external knowledge without cluttering the interface.

5. Collaborative AI Playground
Multiple users can interact with the same AI simultaneously, with conversation branching showing different perspectives and solutions.

Performance & Scalability Targets
Message latency: <100ms for text, <500ms for AI responses
Real-time sync: <50ms for collaborative features
File processing: Support 100MB+ PDFs with intelligent chunking
Concurrent users: 1000+ per instance with horizontal scaling
Offline capability: 7 days of cached conversations and local AI models
