# Chat API Fix Status

## Issue Found and Partially Fixed

### Problem
The chat API was returning a 500 error due to import/compilation issues in the route handler.

### Root Cause
The original chat route had multiple complex imports and some incompatible Next.js patterns that caused the route to fail silently.

### Current Status

#### âœ… Fixed Issues:
1. **Anonymous user model selection** - Fixed in ChatInterface.tsx
2. **Model tier logic** - Working correctly 
3. **Model validation** - Anonymous users properly restricted to Vertex AI models
4. **UI improvements** - Model selector shows correct models for anonymous users

#### ðŸ”„ In Progress:
1. **Chat API route** - Currently simplified and working for testing
2. **Full chat functionality** - Needs gradual restoration of imports

### Testing Results

The simplified API confirms the logic works:
```json
{
  "status": "debug", 
  "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-vertex",
  "modelInfo": {
    "id": "gemini-2.5-flash-vertex",
    "tier": "vertex-ai", 
    "provider": "vertex-ai"
  }
}
```

### Next Steps

1. **Gradually restore imports** to the chat route
2. **Add back streaming functionality** 
3. **Test each provider** (Vertex AI, Azure, Anthropic)
4. **Restore full error handling**

### Immediate Workaround

The UI fixes are complete and working:
- Anonymous users get `gemini-2.5-flash-vertex` by default
- Model selector shows Vertex AI first for anonymous users  
- Usage tracking works correctly

The app is functional for testing the tier system, just needs the streaming chat restored.
